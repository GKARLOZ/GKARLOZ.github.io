            <p>The main goal of the scheduling application is to let the user store appointments in the most efficient way possible while
                 making it easy to understand for the user. This program connects to an Oracle database that will verify the password on the login screen;
                  also store any changes made in the program. Implementing localization and date/time APIs in the program will automatically update the time 
                  to the user's localization. 

                This application was created with Scene Builder for the graphical user interface and coded in NetBeans IDE. The database was modified using MySQL workbench.<br><br> 
                ####### If you would like to try it, the user name is "test" and password is "test"########<br><br>

                <br>The login form is the first part of this application.<br>
                • accepts a user ID and password and provides an appropriate error message<br>
                • determines the user’s location (i.e., ZoneId) and displays it in a  label on the log-in form<br>
                 • displays the log-in form in English or French based on the user’s computer language setting to translate all the text,
                  labels, buttons, and errors on the form.<br>
                • automatically translates error control messages into English or French based on the user’s computer language setting.<br><br>

                The rest of the program has the following functionalities:<br>
                
                • Customer records and appointments can be added, updated, and deleted.<br>
                - Customer IDs are auto-generated, and first-level division (i.e., states, provinces) and country data are collected using separate combo boxes.<br>
                 
                - When updating a customer, the customer data auto-populates in the form.<br>
                 
                • Country and first-level division data is prepopulated in separate combo boxes or lists in the user interface for the user to choose. The first-level list should be filtered by the user’s selection of a country (e.g., when choosing U.S., filter so it only shows states).
                <br>• All of the original customer information is displayed on the update form.
                <br> - Customer_ID must be disabled.
                <br>• All of the fields can be updated except for Customer_ID.
                <br>• Customer data is displayed using a TableView, including first-level division data. A list of all the customers and their information may be viewed in a TableView, and updates of the data can be performed in text fields on the form.
                <br> • When a customer record is deleted, a custom message should display in the user interface.<br><br>

                <br> • A contact name is assigned to an appointment using a drop-down menu or combo box.
                <br>• A custom message is displayed in the user interface with the Appointment_ID and type of appointment canceled.
                <br>• The Appointment_ID is auto-generated and disabled throughout the application.
                <br>• When adding and updating an appointment, record the following data: Appointment_ID, title, description, location, contact, type, start date and time, end date and time, Customer_ID, and User_ID.
                <br>• All of the original appointment information is displayed on the update form in local time zone.
                <br>• All of the appointment fields can be updated except Appointment_ID, which must be disabled.

                <br> <br> <strong> Opinion: </strong>
                
                <br>This project took me some time to finish but it was easy to get it done. I already had some experience using Scene Builder and writing in Java. 
                The most difficult requirement was implementing the date/time functionalities. Since this was my first project using data/time APIs, it was difficult 
                to figure out how to convert my local time to the user's local time. Apparently, I needed to get the localization of the user and convert the local time to 
                UTC time and then to the user's local time. Once I understood the process, it was just a matter of time to get it done. Another requirement that gave me a 
                hard time was the overlap issue. I had created code that could detect if the user accidentally scheduled an appointment that overlaps with another appointment.
                 Solving this challenge was probably the most enjoyable part of this project. I enjoyed designing the GUI but solving problems that make me think is the fun
                  part.
